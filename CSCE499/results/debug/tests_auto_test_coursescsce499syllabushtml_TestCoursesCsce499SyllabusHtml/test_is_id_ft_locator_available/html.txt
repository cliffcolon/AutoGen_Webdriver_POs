<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>
The capstone course is designed to give students the opportunity to apply their
skills to a medium scale, team based project, over the course of two semesters.
Students will gain the experience of bringing a project from conceptualiztion
to implementation.  Projects are undertaken with the assistance of a faculty mentor
(not necessarily the course instructor).  The course will include weekly 
progress reports, presentations, peer review assignments, written reports,
and a presentation of your final product at the division-wide academic festival.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To gain experience working on a medium-scale software and/or hardware
  project.</li>
  <li>To gain technical writing skills.</li>
  <li>To gain skills in oral presentation of technical material.</li>
  <li>To learn to document and be accountable for your progress.</li>
  <li>To put into practice proper software/hardware engineering techniques.</li>
  <li>To become more aware of social, legal, and ethical issues in the computing field.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
<p>
The choice of project area depends on the your major and degree.  
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>BS in Computer Science:</b>  A project that involves the implementation
  of a software system.  These projects must include a substantial programming
  component.  (For dual majors in CS and CE, see below.)</li>
  <li><b>BS in Computer Engineering:</b>  A project that involves the design and
  implementation of a significant
  hardware component.  If your group includes students majoring in Computer Science
  or you yourself are a dual major, your project
  <i>must include</i> the corresponding BS/BA in CS requirements.</li>
  <li><b>BA in Computer Science:</b>  
  The requirements for a BA student are the same as for a BS student in computer 
  science, but the project may be more "research focused" than "implementation focused."
  A BA student may join a group with BS students, however, if you choose to do
  so, you are expected to contribute to the project equally.  Your contributions
  may be less technical than others, but must be equal in terms of effort.  For
  example, the BA student might take the lead on testing, modelling, time 
  management, and research.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
Your capstone project will be carried out over the course of two semesters, and
you will recieve a grade for each semester.  Students are expected to contribute
equally
to their project and meet their obligations in a timely manner.  Academic
dishonesty will not be tolerated.  Grades will be based on the following 
criteria:

<p>
Your overall grade depends on the above weights as well as various
factors including class participation, your contributions to your team, 
accomplishment of project goals, attitude, and timeliness.  Your final grade
will be assigned in consultation with your project advisor.
</p>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>
All work submitted in this course must be your own and produced exclusively for
this course. The use of sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrases) must be
properly acknowledged and documented. For the consequences of academic
dishonesty, refer to the PLU catalog or Please also refer to the PLU catalog or
<a href="http://www.plu.edu/academics/integ.html">
         http://www.plu.edu/academics/integ.html</a>.
In addition, any code or technology that is part of your project that is not 
written/created by you must be clearly indicated in all documentation.  If you 
are in doubt regarding the requirements, please consult with the instructor 
before you complete any requirement of the course.
</p>

<h2>Weather Related Closures</h2> 
<p>In the event of extreme
weather, closure information may be obtained from the "Campus Closure"
hotline (535-7100).  If the university is open, but this class needs
to be cancelled, that information can either be found on the course forum 
or from your instructor's
voice mail message.  Students are urged to use caution
and personal discretion and avoid undue risk and personal danger when
making travel decisions during extreme weather conditions.</p>

<h2>Disabilities</h2>
<p>If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability,
if you have emergency medical information to share with me, or if you
need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated,
please make an appointment with me as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
Students are also reminded that they are responsible for notifying instructors
of any conditions that may impair their academic performance.  Without 
advance warning, such difficulties cannot be used later as a basis
for requesting make-up exams or reconsideration of grades.</p>
